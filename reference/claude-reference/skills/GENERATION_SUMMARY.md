## ðŸš€ How These Skills Work

### Automatic Detection
Claude automatically scans available skills and loads the relevant one(s) based on your query:

**Example 1:**
```
You: "Show me how to build a medallion architecture pipeline"
â†’ Claude loads: databricks-pyspark-delta skill
â†’ Provides: Complete Bronze/Silver/Gold pipeline code
```

**Example 2:**
```
You: "Help me tune hyperparameters for a Random Forest"
â†’ Claude loads: python-ml-datascience skill  
â†’ Provides: GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV examples
```

**Example 3:**
```
You: "How do I deploy my model with MLflow?"
â†’ Claude loads: mlflow-deployment skill
â†’ Provides: Model registration and deployment patterns
```

### Progressive Disclosure
Skills use minimal context by default, loading only what's needed for your specific task to keep Claude fast and efficient.

### Composability
Multiple skills can work together. For example, asking "Build and deploy an ML model on Databricks" could trigger all three skills working in concert.
