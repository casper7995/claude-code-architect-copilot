Perform comprehensive code review for: $ARGUMENTS

Code review checklist:

## 1. Functionality Review
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are all requirements met?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling appropriate?

## 2. Code Quality
**Readability:**
- Is the code easy to understand?
- Are variable/function names descriptive?
- Is the logic flow clear?

**Maintainability:**
- Is the code modular and reusable?
- Does it follow DRY principle?
- Are functions/classes single-purpose?

**Style:**
- Does it follow project conventions?
- Is formatting consistent?
- Are there any linting issues?

## 3. Security Review
