This is a Claude Code plugin system that extends Claude Code with specialized AI agents. The architecture consists of:

1. Five operational modes via .clinerules files (architect, code, test, debug, ask)
2. Seven specialized agents: Memory Agent (smart storage to Memory Bank + Cipher), Best Practices Agent, Sequential Thinking Agent, Databricks Agent (Unity Catalog/Delta Lake expert), GenAI Agent (RAG/vector search), ML Agent (MLflow), Documentation Agent
3. Seven adopted pre-built agents for various roles
4. Hooks system for automatic agent triggering based on keywords, file patterns, and context
5. Memory Bank integration with UMB command for structured storage
6. Cipher integration for semantic memory retrieval

Key patterns:
- Memory Agent uses intelligent heuristics to avoid storing everything - only significant insights
- Databricks Agent is expert in Unity Catalog, Delta Lake, DLT, and leverages Databricks MCPs
- Agents collaborate via mode handoff triggers
- Architect mode is limited to markdown files unless UMB command temporarily overrides

The system integrates multiple MCP servers: Memory Bank, Cipher, Context7, Databricks Functions, Databricks Vector Search, Sequential Thinking, and Fetch.
