The claude-code-architect-copilot project has been successfully restructured into an official Claude Code plugin marketplace. Key achievements:

1. Created proper marketplace structure with .claude-plugin/marketplace.json defining 5 plugin bundles
2. Converted 14 agents (7 custom + 7 adopted) to proper frontmatter format with activation descriptions
3. Plugin bundles created:
   - architect-copilot-essentials (core development)
   - databricks-development-suite (Unity Catalog, Delta Lake, DLT)
   - genai-ml-toolkit (RAG, vector search, MLflow)
   - memory-intelligence (Memory Bank + Cipher integration)
   - architecture-design-system (code review, security, deployment)

4. Model distribution: Opus for complex reasoning (Databricks, GenAI, ML agents), Sonnet for standard development
5. Smart Memory Agent uses heuristics to selectively store significant insights to Memory Bank and Cipher
6. Comprehensive README with installation instructions, usage examples, and agent collaboration patterns
7. Ready for publication to https://github.com/casper7995/claude-code-architect-copilot

Next steps: clean up legacy .clinerules files, test locally, push to GitHub marketplace.
